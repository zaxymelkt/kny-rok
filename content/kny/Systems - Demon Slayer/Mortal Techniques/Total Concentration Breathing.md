# Overview 
Total Concentration Breathing is a breathing technique which involves expanding one's lungs to intake as much air as possible, accelerating one's blood flow and heartbeat while increasing their inner body temperature, resulting in their bones and muscles becoming more excited.

Using Total Concentration Breathing essentially enhances the user's physical traits and capabilities while still remaining human. Such traits include superhuman strength, speed, stamina, durability, endurance, and the mental abilities needed to keep up with their superhuman bodies, such as a faster thought process and reaction time. Being more proficient in Total Concentration Breathing is key in raising one's survivability while fighting [[demons]].

## Superhuman Ability
Normally a human is limited to a [[Point Allocation|stat range]] between [ 1-15 ], however, through the usage of TCB they are able to expand their capabilities, even if momentary.
