# Stone Breathing Overview
Stone Breathing is a Breathing Style that mimics earth and stone and replicates it with the user's movements, techniques and abilities. Most, if not all, known techniques and forms utilize the ground beneath the user and the vast surroundings to generate powerful and sturdy attacks that specialize in both offense and defense.

Although it possesses fewer fundamental techniques than other breathing styles, Stone Breathing maintains its foothold as one of the most deadly and difficult breaths.

## First Form: Serpentinite Bipolar

In this form the user hurls both the flail and axe towards their designated target. Simultaneously, they manipulate the chain by rotating it, which causes both the axe and flail to spin. This rotation imbues the weapons with a drilling and grinding effect, enabling them to penetrate deeply into the target, effectively tearing through defenses or bodies alike.

## Fourth Form: Volcanic Rock, Rapid Conquest

This form sees the user manipulating both the flail and axe at the ends of the chain. They swing the chain on both sides in a wide-ranging attack against their opponents. Through coordinated arm movements, the chain swings freely but under direction, generating centrifugal force from the flail's weights or metal balls. This force propels them outward, potentially striking enemies from a distance, while the axe at the other end advances towards the target, combining a direct melee assault with the wide-ranging strikes.

## Fifth Form: Arcs of Justice

In this form, the user executes a powerful barrage with their flail and axe. The attack is designed to inflict significant damage upon the target. The user ensures that the axe hits first, setting the trajectory for the flail to follow from the opposite side. This synchronized attack results in the flail slamming into the opponent alongside the axe, maximizing impact and ensuring a devastating blow.
