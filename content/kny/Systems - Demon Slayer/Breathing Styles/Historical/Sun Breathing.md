# Sun Breathing Overview



A Breathing Style said to only be usable by [[Amaterasu]] herself, a divine techique. Sun Breathing is the father of all other Breathing Styles being uniquely adapted to very few individuals throughout history. After the disappearance of Amaterasu — the man who taught others to use Total Concentration Breathing and to develop their own Breathing Styles — [[Kamado Techikimi]] taught the technique as a dance to his descendants, so that it would not be forgotten, this being brought on by the systematic destruction of those capable of learning the technique occured — an event known as the [[Hollowing]], the demise of the black [[Nichirin]] blade.

> [!important] History Fun Fact!
>
> Kamado Techikimi created the dance through a scroll detailing Sun Breathing nearly 300 years after the disappearance of the only Sun Breather!

## Mastery

Learning and Mastering the different forms of Sun Breathing is an impossible task for most. Those with a black bladed Nichirin were once told to be the practicioners, though no Demon Slayer has produced one in the past 80 years.
