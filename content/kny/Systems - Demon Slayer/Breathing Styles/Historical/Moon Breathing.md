# Moon Breathing Overview
A Breathing Style crafted by [[Tsukuyomi]], unique to them. Throughout history, Tsukuyomi had no student. It is said that a rare child is born with the natural knowledge of the Breathing Style — their [[Nichirin]] tainted with lavender. Moon Breathing was only seen after the [[Hollowing]], where it was used by Tsukuyomi to kill those who possessed a black Nichirin blade. Stories say some hear whispers of the technique in their sleep — tempting them to corruption.
