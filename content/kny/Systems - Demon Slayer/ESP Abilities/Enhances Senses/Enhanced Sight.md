# Enhanced Sight Overview
They possess extremely sharp eyesight, being able to accurately predict their opponent's next attack and movements by simply observing the subtle shifts of their muscles, joints and the slight movements of their eyes. This allows them to make effective counterattacks and dodges and stay ahead of their opponents.

### Passive

Demon Slayers with Enhanced Sight have their sensory range for sight doubled.

### Dark Vision
You are immune to the 'Dark' setting debuff. You are only half affected by 'Pitch Black' settings.
### Aura Sight
You can see Aura distinguished by colours, with demons possessing a red colour and humans possessing a blue colour. The deeper the red, the more corrupt the demon; while the lighter the blue, the stronger will of a particular human.

### Slowed Time 
You can slow your perception of time down, giving more time to react. Those around you for a single turn will be viewed at -8 SPD. You gain +4 SPD during this turn. Once activated, the ability goes on a four turn cooldown.

### Copy Cat
You are not fooled by the same move twice. With the exception of the buffs associated with a technique, you can perfectly mimic an attack you've witnessed before, doing so on the target when they are using that same attack allows the user to neutralise the damage — so long as their STR allows.

This ability consumes 15 STAM.

### Thread of Fate
You see the weaves of the universe, once every 150 turns, a new thread appears. A thread which keeps you alive. Only a single thread can exist at a time. Once used, the technique goes on cooldown.

The ability consumes 40 STAM.
