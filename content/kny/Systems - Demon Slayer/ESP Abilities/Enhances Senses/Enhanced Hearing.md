The Enhanced Hearing [[content/index|system]]  
# Enhanced Hearing Overview
They possess a heightened sense of hearing, allowing them to detect danger from even the faintest of sounds. Their superhuman hearing has the ability to decipher layers upon layers of sound. They can replicate and tone or note after only a single hearing. This enables one to fight without vision, and some, even while asleep. Moreover, they can discern a human from a demon by comparing the sounds they make.
