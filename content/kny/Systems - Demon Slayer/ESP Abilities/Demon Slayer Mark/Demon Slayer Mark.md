# Overview 
The Demon Slayer Mark (DSM) or more closely referred to as 脈神 *Myaku kami* hasn't been seen since the 戦い知識の *[[Chishiki no Tatakai]]* long forgotten to even the Edo Period. It was said to be the mark of [[Amaterasu]], as they were never seen without one; blessed to other Kami to face against the [[Demons]]. 

The DSM enhances the beholder's focus; their willpower, allowing them fight beyond their natural limit — enhancing the force of their cuts and diminishing the [[Regeneration]] of Demons. It is said those with the DSM exponetially grow when push to near death in battle.

## Unlocking
The DSM evolves and grows according to the battle experience of the user. By pushing one's self in every fight, by continuing to punch upwards, the DSM will strengthen. 

Manifesting the DSM, even once the needed experience is required, may prove impossible for most.

## Stage 0
A Stage unique to those born with the DSM manifested. These individuals are [[Kami]] reincarnated, or so the priests say. They are the disease. They are the future.

While their DSM is not properly manifested, it is maintaining their focus; continuous.

They have an instinctual knowledge of [[Total Concentration Breathing]].
