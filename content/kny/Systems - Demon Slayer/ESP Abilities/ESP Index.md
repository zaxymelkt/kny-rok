Extrasensory Perception (ESP) is the supernatural ability to sense things that cannot be perceived by one's natural senses. This [[content/index|system]] overviews varies ESP abilities.

# Overview
Extrasensory Perception grants the user a "sixth sense" which enables them to sense the paranormal or supernatural. There are two types of ESP:

1. General ESP which demons and Demon Slayers alike possess
2. Specialised ESP which come from supernatural abilities such as Blood Demon Arts.

Generally, more refined ESP is associated with being a more capable and skilled combatant.

## Aura 
Auras function as a sort of beacon which demons and Demon Slayers can pick up through their ESP. The auras of extremely strong demons, such as the Upper Ranks of the [[Twelve Kizuki]], can induce effects such as fear, shuddering, breathlessness, minor pain, and weakness.

### Hyper Awareness
Users of ESP are more acutely aware of the entities in their surroundings through perceiving their presence (or aura), which allows them to pin-point their locations without needing to look at them. 

Most Demon Slayers (particularly [[Hashira]]), are able to sense the presence of demons from an extreme distance.

Demons are capable of discerning humans by [[Blood Type]], disease strains, and even their genes.

### Combative Perception 
ESP can also be used to great effect during combat, mainly through sensing an opponent's bloodlust and murderous intent. Through sensing bloodlust, users are more aware of when and where their opponent will attack, giving more time to prepare countermeasures.

## Transparent World 
[[Transparent World]] is a special form of ESP which enables them to see-through the skin of living beings. By seeing how their muscles contract and their blood-flow, users can also accurately predict where they are going to strike.
