# Injuries Overviews
When facing against [[Demons]], injuries are an expectation for most in the [[Demon Slayer Corps]]. While the [[Demon Slayer Uniform]] is used to help a Slayer fend against injury, it will eventually fail. Nevertheless, avoiding and deflecting potentially fatal attacks are important; where a Slayer is struck is important.

Most Injuries are healed by demons rapidly unless preformed using a [[Nichirin]].

## Level 1 Injuries

### Shallow Laceration
Common among those who wield blades in battle, shallow lacerations are frequent wounds inflicted by demon slayers or demons themselves. Ranging from half an inch to an inch in width and depth. Results in [[Status Effects#Bleed 1|Bleed 1]].
### Superficial Puncture
Often seen on the battlefield, superficial punctures are caused by the sharp fangs of demons or the fine edges of demon-slayer swords. These wounds, though small, can still draw blood. Results in [[Status Effects#Bleed 1|Bleed 1]]
### Minor Bone Bruise
Suffered from impacts during fights or falls, minor bone bruises are common among both demon slayers and demons. These injuries, causing pain, swelling, and tenderness. Results in [[Status Effects#Weakened 1|Weakened 1]].
### First-Degree Burn
In the heat of battle, first-degree burns can occur from the intense flames emitted by demons or from accidental contact with hot equipment. Such burns, affecting only the outer layer of the skin. Results in [[Status Effects#Burned 1|Burned 1]].
### First-Degree Frostbitten
First-degree frostbite is a risk for those unprepared for the harsh winter. Demon slayers patrolling these areas must be vigilant, as the initial stages of frostbite—redness, tingling, and numbness—can precede more severe complications if not addressed promptly. Results in [[Status Effects#Frostbitten 1|Frostbitten 1]].
### Low Severity Poison
Exposure to low-severity poisons is a constant concern for demon slayers, especially when battling demons known to use toxic attacks or when encountering traps laid by demons. These mild symptoms, though concerning, they do not threaten life. Results in [[Status Effects#Poisoned 1|Poisoned 1]].
### Mild Confusion
The mental strain of constant battle and the weight of protecting humanity from demons can lead to moments of mild confusion among demon slayers. This state, characterised by difficulty focusing or making decisions, underscores the psychological toll of their mission. Results in [[Status Effects#Dazed 1|Dazed 1]].

## Level 2 Injuries

### Deep Laceration
In the relentless battles against demons, deep lacerations become a grim reality. These wounds, extending into the subcutaneous fat, are a testament to the ferocity of demon slayer versus demon confrontations. Their size, often spanning several inches, and the potential for significant blood loss usher a critical need for immediate medical attention to prevent shock. Results in [[Status Effects#Bleed 2|Bleed 2]]. and [[Status Effects#Dazed 2|Dazed 2]].
### Deep Puncture
Deep punctures occur when an object penetrates the skin deeply enough to reach the muscle or bone. These injuries can cause severe internal damage depending on the location and depth of the puncture. Results in [[Status Effects#Bleed 2|Bleed 2]] and [[Status Effects#Broken 2|Broken 2]].
### Simple Fracture
A simple fracture is a break in a bone that does not pierce through the skin. These injuries can cause significant pain, swelling, and tenderness around the fracture site. Movement near the fracture can exacerbate pain and further damage the surrounding tissues. Results in [[Status Effects#Broken 2|Broken 2]] and [[Status Effects#Weakened 2|Weakened 2]].
### Second-Degree Burn
Second-degree burns, also known as partial thickness burns, affect both the outer and inner layers of the skin. These burns are characterised by red, white, or brownish skin, blisters, and severe pain. Blisters may burst, leaving raw, sensitive tissue underneath. Results in [[Status Effects#Burned 2|Burned 2]] and [[Status Effects#Weakened 2|Weakened 2]].
