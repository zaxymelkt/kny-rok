# Status Effects Overview

> [!Important] Status Effect Progression
> When inflicted with the same status effect such as [[#Bleed]] or [[#Broken]] of the same level two additional times, it will progress the status effect to the next level.
> 

There are three classifications of Status Effects:
- [[#Type A Status Effects]]:
	- [[#Bleed]]
	- [[#Broken]]
	- [[#Poisoned]]
	- [[#Burned]]
	- [[#Frostbitten]]
- [[#Type B Status Effects]]:
	- [[#Weakened]]
	- [[#Dazed]]
	- [[#Stunned]]
	- [[#Near-Death]]
- [[#Type C Status Effects]]:
	- [[#Paralysed]]
	- [[#Death]]
	- [[#Red Hot]]

Status Effects of the same type do not stat statistical DeBuffs, however, the damage infliction will stack the highest levels of every Status Effect.
