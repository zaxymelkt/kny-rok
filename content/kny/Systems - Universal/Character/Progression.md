## Player Hosted 
Player hosted events are done between two or more players. While there is not minimal or maximum length the roleplay must be, it is recommended to tell a full story with a proper and clear beginning, middle, and end.

While these RPs will not be graded; they will be read over and summarised for the wiki. If you wish for the last memory of a character to be the "Animal Game", be my guest.

To be awarded [[#Stat Points]] or [[#Talent Points]] the player must have completed at least 2 [[#Player Hosted]] events between the start of the week (Sunday) and end of the week (Saturday).

Rewards for Player Hosted events will be distributed to a player's [[Character Sheet]] every Monday.
