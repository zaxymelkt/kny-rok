## Type A
Most of the Japanese population is type A. People with this blood type are described primarily as _kichōmen_, or well-organized. They like to keep things neat but can be stubborn and get stressed out easily. They also value harmony with others. Agricultural people are the root of blood type A.

You are worth 1 human. You do not stave a demon's hunger. You are rancid to them, vile almost, Low-Tier [[Demons]] avoid you for 3 seconds when your blood is exposed.

## Type O 
Blood type O is often described as _rakkanshugi_, or optimistic. They are outgoing, have leadership abilities, and are able to set the mood for groups of people. They don't care much about little things (as you can see from the mikan picture above), so their behavior sometimes freaks out more sensitive A types. Though they're often late to events (and sometimes rude), O types are incredibly resilient and flexible, enabling them to roll with the punches.

You are worth 2 humans. You stave a demon's hunger for 12 seconds. You are bland to them.
## Type B
Blood type B is generally described as jikochū, or selfish. They are also known for their creativity. Blood type B has a strong sense of curiosity, but at the same time, loses interest easily. Though there are a lot of positives to B types, people tend to focus on the negatives for reasons we'll get into later. Some say their root is in nomadic peoples who roamed from place to place.

You are worth 5 humans. You stave a demon's hunger for 1 minute. You are savoury.
## Type AB
Blood type AB is a hybrid of A and B, two different personalities mixed together. They are often seen as dual-natured and complicated. For example, they are shy like A types, but also are outgoing like type B. Blood type AB is the rarest in Japan (and many other places in the world, too), so they are hard to find. They are often stereotyped as 'eccentric'.
