# Yayoi Period 
[ 300 BC to 250 AD ]

## Conflict Amongst the Kotoamatsukami

During the Yayoi Period, the [[Kotoamatsukami]] began to experience conflicts amongst themselves. These powerful beings, created by [[Kuninotokotachi]], found their differing influences and domains clashing. This period of turmoil reflected in the natural world, leading to changes in the environment and disturbances in human societies.

## Flourishing Izanagi and Izanami
The deities [[Izanagi]] and [[Izanami]] continued to play crucial roles during the Yayoi Period. They were revered for their creation of the islands and their influence over life and death. Despite the conflicts among the Kotoamatsukami, Izanagi and Izanami remained central to the spiritual beliefs of the people.

## Amaterasu's Visit 

Amidst this conflict, a significant figure emerged: [[Amaterasu]]. Born with a [[Demon Slayer Mark]], she possessed extraordinary abilities. She could see into the [[Transparent World]], perceiving the true nature of beings and the flow of energy around her. Amaterasu was always in the [[Selfless State]], embodying purity and selflessness.

## Wars and Conflicts Among Humans

The Yayoi Period was also marked by increased conflicts among human societies. As agricultural practices spread and communities grew, competition for resources intensified. The spiritual turmoil among the [[Kotoamatsukami]] mirrored these earthly conflicts, with different tribes and clans vying for dominance.

# Kofun Period 
[ 250 AD to 538 AD ]

The Kofun Period marked a significant transformation in ancient Japan. During this time, large keyhole-shaped tombs, or kofun, were constructed, symbolising the emergence of powerful rulers and the unification of various clans under centralised authority.

### Consolidation of Power

The conflicts among the [[Kotoamatsukami]] during the Yayoi Period had profound impacts on the human world. As the divine beings struggled, human societies sought stability through consolidation of power. Strong leaders emerged, claiming divine right to rule, and began uniting smaller tribes and communities into larger, more centralised states.

### Divine Intervention and Human Governance

The influence of [[Izanagi]] and [[Izanami]] persisted as central figures in the spiritual life of the people. Their roles as creators and stabilizers were invoked by the new rulers to legitimize their authority. Rituals and ceremonies dedicated to these deities were held to ensure the continued favor of the gods and the prosperity of the land.

### Amaterasu's Legacy

The legacy of [[Amaterasu]], the incarnation born during the Yayoi Period, continued to resonate. Her ability to see into the [[Transparent World]] and her perpetual [[Selfless State]] were revered by the rulers of the Kofun Period. Temples and shrines dedicated to Amaterasu became centers of spiritual and political power, where rulers sought her guidance and blessings.

## Conflict and Resolution Among the Kotoamatsukami

The Kotoamatsukami, still divided by their differences, continued to influence the world. Their conflicts occasionally manifested in natural disasters, such as earthquakes and storms, which were interpreted as signs of divine displeasure or struggles among the gods. The rulers of the Kofun Period took these events seriously, performing elaborate rituals to appease the Kotoamatsukami and restore balance.

### The Role of Amenominakanushi, Takamimusubi, and Kamimusubi

- **[[Amenominakanushi]]**: As the supreme ruler of the heavens, Amenominakanushi's influence was invoked by the emperors to legitimize their rule. His authority was seen as the ultimate source of their power, and his favor was essential for maintaining cosmic order.
  
- **[[Takamimusubi]]**: Representing creation and growth, Takamimusubi's blessings were sought for agricultural prosperity and the fertility of the land. Festivals and ceremonies dedicated to Takamimusubi ensured bountiful harvests and the well-being of the people.
  
- **[[Kamimusubi]]**: As the god of spiritual power and transformation, Kamimusubi's teachings were integrated into the moral and ethical frameworks of society. His guidance was crucial for spiritual growth and maintaining harmony within the community.

## Human Wars and the Divine Struggles

Human conflicts continued during the Kofun Period. As powerful clans vied for control, battles and wars erupted. These conflicts were seen as reflections of the celestial battles, with each side claiming the support of different deities.

### Spiritual Practices and Social Order

The rulers of the Kofun Period used spiritual practices to maintain social order and justify their authority. They performed rituals to honor the [[Kotoamatsukami]] and sought their favor in times of war and peace. The teachings of [[Amaterasu]] were particularly influential, guiding rulers in the principles of selflessness and divine insight.

### The Construction of Kofun

The construction of large tombs, or kofun, became a significant practice during this period. These tombs were built for the powerful rulers and were believed to ensure their continued influence in the afterlife. The kofun symbolized the divine connection of the rulers, emphasizing their role as intermediaries between the gods and the people.

### Preservation of Knowledge

After the fall of the Kotoamatsukami, Amaterasu and [[Kamado Techikimi]] worked tirelessly to ensure that the knowledge and techniques developed during their battles would not be lost.

## Creation of the Demon Slayer Corps 
The [[Ubuyashiki]] family, believed to be the descendants of those who entrapped [[Kuninotokotachi]] back in the [[#Jomon Period]], were cursed with short lives as a consequence of their actions. Despite this, they took on the monumental task of creating the Demon Slayer Corps, an organisation dedicated to defeating [[The Demon King]] and protecting humanity from demonic threats. Under their leadership, the [[Demon Slayer Corps]] united the Incarnated Kami, or gods, forming the elite group known as the [[Hashira]].

## Return of Amaterasu

In the Nara Period, the ancient land witnessed the miraculous return of [[Amaterasu]]. This incarnation was a child born with a [[Demon Slayer Mark]], possessing the same abilities to see into the [[Transparent World]] and maintain a constant [[Selfless State]].

She was not the only of the Kami to incarnate.

## Fall of the Kotoamatsukami

The Asuka Period also marked the decline of the once-powerful [[Kotoamatsukami]]. Each member of this divine trio confronted Amaterasu, leading to epic battles that would determine the fate of the land.

Amaterasu faced the Kotoamatsukami in a series of fierce confrontations. Despite their immense power, each member of the Kotoamatsukami ultimately fell to Amaterasu's might and strategic prowess.

- **[[Amenominakanushi]]**: The supreme ruler of the heavens wielded the ability to cast an inescapable illusion through reciting a poem and expending his blood. However, Amaterasu's keen insight into the [[Transparent World]] allowed her to see through the illusion, and with the help of Nichirin, she was able to defeat him.
    
- **[[Takamimusubi]]**: Takamimusubi used his blood to create and control plants that feasted on blood and grew rapidly from any surface. Amaterasu, with her mastery of [[Sun Breathing]], burned through the deadly flora, ultimately slaying Takamimusubi and ending his reign of terror.
    
- **[[Kamimusubi]]**: Kamimusubi had the ability to create a replica, known as a Blood Puppet, of anyone he consumed. This ability to mirror his opponents made him a formidable adversary. However, Amaterasu's [[Total Concentration Breathing]] and [[Combat System|combat]] skills enabled her to outmanoeuvre and destroy both Kamimusubi and his replicas.

## Incarnated Kami

During this period, several Kami reincarnated into human form, bringing their abilities to aid in the fight against demons.

### Hachiman

Incarnating as a human, [[Hachiman]] played a pivotal role in the development of the [[Demon Slayer Corps]]. He introduced the concept of [[Total Concentration Breathing]] to humanity, a technique that allowed the demon slayers to enhance their physical and mental capabilities to superhuman levels. This breathing technique became fundamental to the combat style of the Corps, enabling them to face demons with greater strength and agility.

### Amatsumara

Incarnating as a human, [[Amatsumara]]'s contribution to the Demon Slayer Corps was significant. Reincarnated to assist humanity, he brough the [[Nichirin]] Katana to the people. This metal, with the essence of the sun itself, was able to slay demons. The introduction of Nichirin weapons revolutionised the demon slayers' arsenal, providing them with a potent tool in their battle against the false gods.

### Kōjin

Incarnating as a human, [[Kōjin]] brought the art of [[Flame Breathing]] to the people. This breathing technique enabled the demon slayers to visualise flame as a weapon, adding a powerful offensive capability to their combat repertoire. The flames of Flame Breathing were not only devastating to demons but also served as a symbol of purification, cleansing the world of evil.

### Ryūjin

Incarnating as a human, [[Ryūjin]] introduced the art of [[Water Breathing]] to the people. This breathing technique allowed the demon slayers to harness the power of water, using it both defensively and offensively in combat. Water Breathing was known for its fluid and adaptable nature, mirroring the ebb and flow of the natural world.

### Raijin

Incarnating as a human, [[Raijin]] brought the potent [[Thunder Breathing]] technique to humanity. This breathing style allowed the demon slayers to generate and control electricity, unleashing devastating attacks against their demonic foes. Thunder Breathing was known for its speed and power, striking down demons with lightning-fast precision.

### Fūjin

Incarnating as a human, [[Fūjin]] brought the art of [[Wind Breathing]] to humanity. This breathing technique allowed the demon slayers to manipulate and control the air around them, creating powerful gusts and slicing winds to attack their enemies. Wind Breathing was known for its speed and cutting power, slicing through demons with razor-sharp precision.

### Ōyamatsumi

Incarnating as a human, [[Ōyamatsumi]] introduced the art of [[Stone Breathing]] to the people. This breathing technique allowed the demon slayers to manipulate and control earth and stone, using them as defensive barriers or powerful weapons against their enemies. Stone Breathing was known for its solidity and resilience, providing a strong defense against demonic attacks.

## The Rise of the Twelve Kizuki

Following [[Amaterasu]] disappearance after the [[#Nara & Heian Period|Nara Period]], the world was plunged into turmoil as the powerful demon [[Tsukuyomi]] emerged, heralding the rise of the [[Twelve Kizuki]]. These upper moon demons, handpicked by [[The Demon King]] himself, stood as the vanguard of darkness, each possessing formidable powers and abilities that made them a grave threat to humanity.

The emergence of these powerful demons posed a dire threat to humanity, prompting the Demon Slayer Corps to redouble their efforts in combating the forces of darkness. With each encounter, the Corps honed their skills and strategies, determined to push back the tide of evil and protect the world from the tyranny of the Twelve Kizuki.

### Izanagi and Izanami

The third among the Twelve Kizuki were the twin demons [[Izanagi]] and [[Izanami]], who wielded the powers of creation and destruction. Together, they could reshape the very fabric of reality, making them a formidable duo to contend with.

### Ukemochi

[[Ukemochi]], the fourth upper moon demon, little is known about this one's abilities.
